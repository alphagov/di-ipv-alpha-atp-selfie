  title: Onfido Sandbox
  content:
    - Onfido's Sandbox mode uses predetermined check results and does not do any live processing of data
    - These predetermined checks are configured the use of special firstName and lastName values
    - - e.g A surname of "rejected" will return a rejected response
    - The next few screens ask questions to configure these special names
    - This data is then sent to Onfido to be run as a check

  content:
    - "Onfido provides two different ways of uploading documents:"
    - - Direct API access, which will allow us to style things fully in the GDS way
    - - Web SDK usage, which uses Onfido's file uploading screens
    - At the end of the file uploading stage, we will still use the direct API to run checks and reports

onfidoGDSStyle:
  title: GDS Style Integration
  content:
    - In this approach this ATP handles all of the document and photo upload reponsibility
    - - In production, this would entail proper storage of uploaded files, with deletion policies
    - - In this demo, everything is saved into the session, which is then saved into Redis
    - "Note: Only sample documents should be uploaded"

onfidoOnfidoStyle:
  title: Onfido Style Integration
  content:
    - In this approach this ATP uses the Ofido web SDK to upload the document and photo
    - A unique web SDK key is generated for each user
    - The Onfido backend API is used for running the checks, in the same way as the GDS style integration
    - "Note: Only sample documents should be uploaded"

onfidoCheckStatus:
  title: Processing results
  content:
    - This page would be a holding page while we wait for Onfido's server to finish processing the document and photo
    - - In production, Onfido would post to a webhook endpoint that is on our infrastrcture
    - - In this demo, response times are quick, so we can wait a few seconds on this page
    - " "
    - If a result came back needing human assessment, this is the jumping off point from where we would need to do Save & Return
